# Experience

This section presents the key experiences and lessons learned during the development and deployment of **Binspire: Smart Community Waste Management System with IoT**.  

The project provided exposure to real-world challenges in integrating hardware, software, and community collaboration.

## Overview

Developing Binspire allowed the team to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world community project.  

The experience highlighted the difference between designing a system on paper and deploying it in an environment where conditions constantly changed.  

Through iterative testing and continuous refinement, the concept was transformed into a functioning IoT solution.

## Technical Experience (Hardware + Software Integration)

Working with IoT components such as the Raspberry Pi 4, ultrasonic sensors, solar-powered modules, and a real-time dashboard provided hands-on experience requiring precision and adaptability.

### Key experiences:
- Calibrated sensors to measure accurate waste levels inside a bin.
- Configured real-time data transmission from the bin to the dashboard.
- Managed power fluctuations caused by varying sunlight during solar charging.
- Debugged hardware wiring issues and GPIO mapping on the Raspberry Pi.

IoT systems were not plug-and-play. Every component required testing, calibration, and validation under real conditions.

## Field Deployment Experience

Deployment revealed challenges that were observable only during real field testing.

### Field realities encountered:
- Weak or unstable Wi-Fi signals affected data transmission.
- Solar charging output fluctuated depending on weather conditions and bin placement.
- Sensor readings varied due to bin shape and waste surface reflection.

The environment significantly influenced the system. Designs needed to adapt to real conditions, not the other way around.

## Collaboration & Stakeholder Engagement

Throughout the project, collaboration occurred with:
- **Waste collectors** to understand workflow and pain points.
- **System administrators** to validate dashboard usability.
- **Community partners** to gather insights during pilot deployment.

### Insights gained:
- Collectors preferred automated alerts over manual bin checking.
- Administrators valued analytics and activity history for decision-making.
- User feedback directly influenced improvements in the UI and routing logic.

A successful system required empathy-driven design. The technology needed to serve the users, not impress the developers.

## Growth and Skill Development
