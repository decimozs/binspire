# Permissions

This section describes how permissions operated within the Binspire: Smart Community Waste Management System with IoT. The system used a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) structure to ensure that each user accessed only the features necessary for their assigned duties. Permissions were automatically applied after account approval and role assignment by the administrator.

## Role-Based Permission Structure

The system defined two main roles:

| Role | Permission Level | Access Description |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Administrator | Full system access | Managed users, approved accounts, viewed reports, monitored system activity |
| Collector | Operational access | Viewed assignments, monitored bin status, followed collection routes, marked tasks completed |

RBAC prevented unauthorized access to restricted system features.

## How Permissions Were Applied (Step-by-Step)

1. A new user created an account using the registration page.
2. The account remained in Pending status until an administrator reviewed and approved it.
3. During approval, the administrator assigned a role (Admin or Collector).
4. After assignment, the system automatically granted permissions linked to the role.

Users did not manually select permissions — the system applied them based on role.

## Actions Allowed Per Role

### Administrator Permissions
Administrators were allowed to:

- approve or reject new account registrations
- assign or update user roles
- monitor all smart bin activity on the dashboard
- view analytics and collection reports
- manage alert escalation and system configuration

### Collector Permissions
Collectors were allowed to:

- view bin status and alert notifications
- access optimized routes generated by the routing module
- mark bins as Collected once pickup was completed
- submit issue reports when problems occurred

Collectors did not have access to account management screens.

## Permission Enforcement

The system enforced permissions through:

- restricted dashboard views
- disabled interface elements for unauthorized roles
- backend permission checks before executing actions
- session verification during every access request

If a user attempted to access a feature outside their permission level, the system redirected them back to their authorized dashboard.

## Security and Accountability

- All actions were logged into the History/Audit module
- Changes to accounts or bin statuses were timestamped and stored for record-keeping
- This provided transparency and traceability for all users

Permission control improved security and ensured operational accountability.
