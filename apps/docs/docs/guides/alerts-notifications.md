# Alerts and Notification

This section explains how the Alerts and Notification feature operates in the Binspire: Smart Community Waste Management System with IoT.  

The system automatically detects bin status changes and notifies collectors and administrators when a bin requires immediate action. Alert generation and notifications are based on the real-time data transmitted from the Raspberry Pi to the dashboard.

## How Alerts Were Triggered

Alerts are automatically generated when:

1. The ultrasonic sensor detects that the waste level has reached a predefined threshold.
2. The bin status changes to Full or Overflowing.
3. The system classifies waste level and pushes the update to the dashboard.

The system continuously monitors the sensor and updates values at determined intervals.  
Once triggered, the alert is visible on the dashboard and marks the bin as requiring immediate pickup.

## Notification Flow (Step-by-Step)

1. The Raspberry Pi detects the bin status and transmits the update to the backend.
2. The dashboard receives the status change and displays alert indicators such as:
   - red status icon,
   - priority label, and
   - timestamp of the most recent detected bin status.
3. The system checks routing rules and schedules the bin for collection.
4. If multiple bins are full, the Dynamic Scheduling Algorithm calculates priority, and the optimized route is generated automatically for the collector.
5. The collector views the alert through the dashboard and proceeds to collect waste.

The system removes the alert and resets the bin status once the task is marked as completed.

## Types of Alerts Displayed

| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | User Receiving Alert |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Bin Full | Sensor detected bin level reached threshold | Collector + Administrator |
| Bin Overflowing | Bin exceeded waste height limit | Collector + Administrator |
| Device Not Sending Data | Raspberry Pi stopped transmitting updates | Administrator |
| Maintenance Alert | Sensor or camera malfunction detected | Administrator |

These alerts ensure that no full or overflowing bin is missed during day-to-day operations.

## What Collectors Did Upon Notification

Once an alert appears:

1. The collector opens the dashboard.
2. Views the optimized route auto-generated by the routing module.
3. Collects the waste from the bin following the assigned route.
4. Marks the bin as Collected on the dashboard.

This acknowledges the alert and resets the bin status.

## What Administrators Did Upon Notification

Administrators monitor alerts and perform:

- Verification of repeated alerts
- Escalation of unresolved bin status
- Assignment of collectors when necessary

Administrators are allowed to track completed alerts using the system history and audit logs.
