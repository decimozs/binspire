# Security Policy

Our mission at **Binspire** is to ensure that security issues are addressed promptly and responsibly, minimizing risks for our users, contributors, and partners. We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping Binspire safe.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in Binspire, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**
- Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Public exposure can inadvertently provide attackers with sensitive information before the issue is resolved.

### 2. **Do Not Submit a Pull Request**
- Avoid submitting a pull request with a fix before reporting the vulnerability. This allows our security team to verify and address the issue appropriately before any public changes are made.

### 3. **Contact Us Directly**
- Email our security team at **[contact.binspire@gmail.com](mailto:contact.binspire@gmail.com)**.
- Please include detailed information such as:
  - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
  - Environment details (OS, browser, version, etc.).
  - Any potential impact or risk assessment.
  - Screenshots or code snippets if applicable.

### 4. **Use GitHub Draft Security Advisories (Optional)**
- If you prefer to use GitHub to report, you may create a draft security advisory using the template "Report a security vulnerability."
- If you’ve already created a fix, fill out the draft advisory and submit it for review before publishing.

## Our Response Process

- We will **acknowledge receipt of your report within 5 business days**.
- We may reach out for further information, clarification, or testing if necessary.
- After verification and resolution, we will **publicly disclose the vulnerability** (with your consent for attribution).

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Avoid testing vulnerabilities on production systems without permission.
- Do not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Refrain from sharing details of the vulnerability until it has been resolved.

## Recognition

- We **credit all researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities** in public acknowledgements with their consent.

Thank you for helping us maintain a secure ecosystem at Binspire. Responsible disclosure protects everyone and strengthens our community.
